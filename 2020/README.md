#### Debian 7.8
Pre-Comp
--check users that need to be on the system so i know whats weird
--learn how mysql works so i can run the mysql_secure_installation thing to make it secure


Comp
--change password on root and sysadmin
--iptables -F to flush in case there's dumb network rules
--uninstall nc because netcat sucks
--remove ssh auth keys
--edit sshd_config file to disallow root login, change port to something other than 22 so its not obvious (we needed SSH to access the MySQL database from the web server)
--add sysadmin to sudoers
--check /etc/passwd for weird users, change all shells i dont need to /bin/false
--check /etc/sudoers
--check /etc/sudoers.d
--edit the mysql tables to allow a specific user to have access to the frog table that we needed (on localhost, then the web server SSHes into it with -L to "pretend" like he's localhost accessing all of it)
--upgrade system (change sources to archive.debian.org......)
--check .bashrc for weird stuff
--uninstall cron
--uninstall/disable apache2
--check home folder for suspicious things/files as hints to problems
--after all upgrades done, install ufw and deny everything (default deny in & out) except access to the web server on ONE port (SSH so he could access the MySQL)
  --if something was going on with the web server, i cut the ssh connection so it wouldnt spread to my system, then when he was ready to go again i re enabled it
  
 --when the competition was about to end and everyones systems were dying I just denied everything and sat there staring at my screen while all the other systems died
