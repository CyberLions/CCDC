- I'll start the thread within this message, but I want everyone (including @Namo and @Petr Esakov) to claim a box (i.e. OS and services associated in topology) and pull together the different resources we've created into an actionable sheet. See the above .jpg for reference.
- The sheet should AT LEAST cover basic user, F/W, and service management, as well as reminders on how to kick users, create short scripts, etc.
- Without including Namo, Petr, and me (Red Team), there should be no more than 2 people per box. First come, first served basis.
- Quite a few people were deer in headlights tonight (much of that was my fault). If we can get you your first set of credentials, you should be able to do the rest with confidence next week.
- As always, please have your sheet uploaded before 8:00 PM 3/5.
